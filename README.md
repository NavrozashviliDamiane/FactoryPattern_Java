FactoryPattern_Java Repository
Welcome to the FactoryPattern_Java repository! This repository contains Java code that demonstrates the Factory Pattern, a creational design pattern used to create objects without specifying the exact class of object that will be created.

What is the Factory Pattern?
The Factory Pattern is one of the creational design patterns that provides an interface for creating objects in a super class but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. This pattern promotes loose coupling by abstracting the process of object creation.
